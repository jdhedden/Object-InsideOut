Object-InsideOut version 0.04.00
================================

This module provides comprehensive support for implementing classes using the
inside-out object model.

This module implements inside-out objects as anonymous scalar references that
have been blessed into a class with the scalar containing the ID for the
object (usually its 'refaddr').  Object data (i.e., fields) are stored in
hashes within the class's package and are keyed to the object's ID.

This module offers all the capabilities of Class::Std with the following
additional key advantages:

= Speed
As fast as 'blessed hash' objects for fetching and setting data, and 2.5-4.5
times faster than Class::Std.

= Threads
Class::Std is not thread safe.  Object::InsideOUt is thread safe, and
thoroughly supports sharing objects between threads using 'threads::shared'.

= Flexibility
Allows control over object ID specification, accessor naming, parameter name
matching, and more.
